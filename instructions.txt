* In Python implement a REST API that models sensors and their associated readings.
* A sensor should have at least the following attributes:
    * sensor id
    * sensor name
    * sensor type
    * location
    * activation date

* Associated value readings should have at least the following attributes:
    * sensor reading id
    * sensor reading value
    * date/time of measurement

* The API should provide the endpoints to satisfy at least the following functional requirements:
    * list sensors
    * add sensor
    * remove sensor
    * get sensor by id
    * get sensor by location
    * insert sensor value(s)
    * get sensor values by their name and date of creation. # NOTE: it should be by sensor id, name does not guarentee uniqueness
    * get a values structure that provides daily aggregation values (e.g. min, q1, median, q3, max) for a given sensor id. # NOTE: also needs date otherwise we will pull more and more data as timeseries data grows.
